                Imagine you are in a retail grocery store (supermarket) to buy your day to day requirements during peak hour. 
                Upon filling your shopping cart, you proceed to the store exit and witness 3 service queues (cashier counters).
        input(type="button" onclick='gotoLine()' style={margin:'5px'} value="Start")
        script.
            setTimeout(function () {
                window.location.href = "/lines"; //will redirect to your blog page (an ex: blog.html)
            }, 30000); //will call the function after 2 secs.

            function gotoLine(){
                window.location.href = "/lines"; 
            }
